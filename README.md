- 👋 Hi, I’m @srgevrg but you can call me Kendall
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and my concentration is in Mobile and Web Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Enineering and East Carolina University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything with any beginners like me, specifically in Python and HTML.
- 🤔 I'm doing research and practicing with Django as of 11/2022, and soon look to do more research on Flask.
